# nostalgic-swartz - VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer by Avi Networks on top of GCP infrastructure using Terraform + Ansible.

## Overview
Framework for deploying infrastructure on GCP leverages Terraform, which includes the creation of VPC networking components as well as VM instances for the Avi controller and a Jumpbox for testing/management. Ansible is used to configure Avi, including the basic system settings and creating a GCP cloud on a two-arm config mode. For more details please refer to the following articles:
